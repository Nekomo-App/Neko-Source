## ✨ About

This repository contains the source code for **Nekomo**, an anime and manga tracking client for Android and Android TV. The application itself does **not** host any anime or manga content.

- 🎌 AniList, MyAnimeList and Kitsu sign-in and sync (AniList is also the metadata catalogue)
- 🧩 **Bring your own sources.** Nekomo ships with **no** sources, repositories or extensions. You add a repository URL
  yourself and install what you want. Supported: CloudStream (`.cs3`), Zangetsu (JS), Aniyomi (anime APKs) and
  Mihon (manga APKs, `index.min.json` or `index.pb`)
- 🔀 Per-title **source chooser**, plus settings to show movies/TV shows and 18+ content (both **off by default**; the 18+ switch asks you to confirm your age)
- 📖 Built-in manga reader for Mihon sources
- 📱🖥️ Phone and Android TV flavors from one codebase, with stable / beta / debug channels
- 🔄 In-app updater that reads GitHub releases (stable or pre-release channel, configurable repositories)
- 🏠 **Customizable home page**: trending, popular, recently updated, recommended and genre rows. Choose your sources
  (AniList by default; optional MyAnimeList via Jikan and Kitsu; official-service link-outs such as Crunchyroll and
  HIDIVE; rows from your own CloudStream providers), switch rows on or off and reorder them
- 🔎 Search history, plus a rich title page (rating, status, genres, format, season, studio, release date, synopsis)
- 📚 **Offline library** that works without an account (export, import, or sync to AniList later)
- 🕶️ Incognito mode and an optional device-lock for the 18+ switch
- 📄 In-app About, DMCA notice and Rules pages that link to the full text on the website
- 🔒 Optional DNS-over-HTTPS for the app's own API traffic
- 🪵 Persistent in-app error log with one-tap GitHub issue reporting

## 🛠️ Building

Requires a **JDK 17** and the **Android SDK** (versions per `app/build.gradle`). The app supports **Android 7.0 (API 24) and newer**.

```bash
./gradlew assemblePhoneDebug   # phone build
./gradlew assembleTvDebug      # Android TV build
./gradlew lint
```

Release outputs are named `Nekomo-<phone|tv>-<release|beta|debug>.apk`. Publish them as GitHub release assets with
`scripts/publish-release.sh <version> [stable|beta]` — the in-app updater matches those names. The website's direct-download links point at the `apks/` folder of this repo (fixed file names, overwritten on every build), so rebuilt APKs are committed there.

> [!TIP]
> On Windows/OneDrive, a first build can fail with `AAPT: failed writing to ... R.txt`. It's transient — just re-run the same command, one variant at a time.
